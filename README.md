Sentiment analysis on tweets data



Used a tensorflow recurrent neural network to make our predictions so i'm importing some standard libraries
Such as numpy and pandas of course plotly for visualization
and then for pre-processing used regular expressions from the natural language toolkit.
getting stop words and then from keras our pre-processing got tokenizer and pad
sequences and from sklearn Got the trained test split function.
Trained and tested and plotted
